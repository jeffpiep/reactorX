# reactorX

An Atari entry to the [2019 BASIC 10-Liner Contest](http://gkanold.wixsite.com/homeputerium/kopie-von-basic-10liners-2019) - inspired by Gottlieb's [Reactor](https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9274). Written in [FastBasic](https://github.com/dmsc/fastbasic) 4.0.

[Download the XEX](https://github.com/jeffpiep/reactorX/raw/master/reactorx.xex) file and play on your favorite 800XL emulator (e.g., [Altirra](http://www.virtualdub.org/altirra.html)). Or, play on real hardware with the [ATR file](https://github.com/jeffpiep/reactorX/raw/master/reactorX.atr).

See my [writeup](https://jeffpiepmeier.blogspot.com/2019/02/reactorx.html).

ReactorX requires one joystick to play. Manuever your ship to bump the particles into the outer wall before the core expands and the reactor goes into meltdown.
